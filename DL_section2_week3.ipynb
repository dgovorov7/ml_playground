    "In the same way we normalize the input layer:\n",
    "\n",

    "beta = 0 # learnable parameters of NN\n",
    "\n",
    "z_new[n] = gamma * z_norm + beta\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch norm normalizes values deep in the network, but you do not want the values to always stay at mean 0 and variance 1\n",
    "\n",
    "If that happened, it could limit what the network can represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using gamma and beta NN can tune these parameters to change the disruption to make the most use out of the non linear activation function\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch norm helps training by making each layer see more stable distributions during training, which makes optimization easier and often much faster\n",

    "covariant shift: Covariant shift is a phenomenon in machine learning where the statistical distribution of the input variables (covariances or features) in the production or test data changes from that in the training data, while the underlying relationship between the inputs and outputs remains the same\n",

    "by normalizing data we reduce this covariant shift\n",

    "### regularization effect\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch norm introduces slight noise because mean and variance are estimated from each mini batch rather than the full dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "noise comes from it trying to estimate mean and variance for a relatively small dataset compared to the bull batch when in mini batch\n",
    "\n",
    "as it adds noise it forces downstream layers to not rely on any 1 single input\n",
